# CHAPTER 6 - DRIVING MOTORS
Raspberry GPIO will be attached a Motor Driver Board L298N H-bridge specialized in dealing with DC motors and steppers.

# MOTOR DRIVER CONTROLLER
* Designed to interact with DC motors and steppers
* Use PWM signals

# MOTORS
* Convert electrical energy into rotational energy
* Different types of motors
  * The simples Motor is a DC Motor
  * A servomotor is composed of a DC motor, potentiometer, and gearing.
  * A stepper motor is precise by using electrical impulses
  * A coreless rearranges a DC motor for efficiency
