# BOOK - BEGINNING ROBOTICS WITH RASPBERRY PI & ARDUINO USING PYTHON AND OPENCV (2018)

This book builds a small mobile robot by using Raspbery Pi, Arduino, Python, OpenCV, and some C++ language.

* Ultrasonic rangefinders will allow to sense the distance between an object and the robot.
* Infrared sensors will detect the contrast between colors white/black.
* The wheels will be controlled by a motor controller.
* Python is used in Raspberry Pi and C subset in Arduino
* Arduino will serve to recollect sensors data, while Raspberry Pi will process the data to tell the wheels what to do.
* In this book Raspberry Pi becomes useful when using OpenCV
* When doing robotics you will need use Linux at some point to unlock more capabilities.
* Raspberry Pi uses Linux. Other OSs can be installed, but it is recommended Raspbian

# ERRATA
* The final robot will end up costing $100 >. As a protoype robot for learning is ok, but we can do better than that.
* Errata is absent for this book, and the original repository has been relocated.
* Some errors in the coding that may probe difficult to solve to beginners in programming, otherwise doable.
* Author will utilize a few electronics without specifying the brand and model in two sections which may become a roadblock for some users.

# VOCABULARY
* GPIO - General Purpose Input Output
