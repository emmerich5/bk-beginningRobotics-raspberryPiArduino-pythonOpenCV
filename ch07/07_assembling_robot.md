# CHAPTER 02 - ASSEMBLING THE ROBOT

# MATERIALS

Plastic materials come in sheets.

* Metal Chassis is durable, expensive
* Plastic is less expensive. Different types.
   * Acrylic: Inexpensive. Scratches easily, inflexible, breaks in sharp pieces. Not recommended when high friction.
   * ABS: Inexpensive. Drillable.
   * Polystyrene: Expensive. Styrene is what most rover kits are made of. Better than ABS and Acrylic.
