# ARDUINO

* 14 Digital pins (Can be used as Software PWM)
* 6 Analog pins (dedicated pins A0 to A5)
* 6 Hardware PWM pins
* TTL Serial, SPI
* 2 Wire serial

* Any IO pin can be use for digital operations (DIGITAL OUTPUT/INPUT)
* All microcontrollers can never  do real analog
  * Analog Ouput is done by using pulse width modulation (PWM)
  * Analog Input is done by using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) which is a hardware function,
    but only available on specifics pins (PIN A0 to A5)
